\chapter{Introduction}

\section{What about it?}

The idea behind of the develop ot this software isn't only to do a
good tool for educational centers, is also an excuse to research and
learn about a lot of technologies and patterns but above all it's
about how to do clean, simple and easily readable sotware.

This software has been thinked to help a lot of teachers in their
work, but which is exactly the problem? And how it will help?

Until a few years ago the digitalization of education was something
imposible to think, the cost of equipments and the digital illiteracy
did imposible to think in to do things of another way. The only computers
that we could see was inside the 'Computer room', where students learnd
to use a simple text processor, received a simple notions of internet
of websites, mail system or storage devices, isn't bad to start, but
we don't talk about this. And what about teachers? Maybe a few of
computers in some rooms or office allow them send mails, maybe build
a simple website or offers some resource to the students (in the better
case). As we can imagine, the paper was the mainly support of all
about management of the center.

If we think about proccesses in a scholar center we can't imagine
the amount of paper that is necesary to registry all about students,
teachers, subjects, relationships between them and the rest of work.
And the worst of this is that every three months and every year the
most of this documents, papers, records, etc, need be redo, because
the mayority of this relations will change and will be necesary record
all.

Can you imagine the amout of papers, time and efforce is necesary
to do this? We will talk more about this after.

So now all peple have a smarphone, the hardware is really cheap (laptops,
tablets, etc...) and open a website for a inexperted person is very
easy, and almos free, in some clicks. There are alot of system and
tools about e-learning like Moodle, Chamilio , etc that allows manage
a lot of thigs like classroom, activities, exams, ect... all had been
listen somethimes about it but they have an specific domain and are
builded to an specific way.

This area is more or less knowled for the mayority of new teachers
and schooll stuff. Many center uses some tools like this to do a lot
of tasks, but in spite of it, there are another a lo of tool much
very heavy that is following hand made.arises

\section{Why to build a new tool?}

But is really necesary build to zero a new tool for do this. Well,
if we want, could reuse some preexisintg tool, maybe adding some module
to do all things that we detect that fault, but this present a lot
of problem, that are closely related with the architecture and liceses
of this software. Because of this, is putted a lot of effor in this
project in the opennes of code and architecture, beause this is that
make possible that the platform can be change, evolutionate in many
forks and feedback herself.

\section{Domain of the problem}

The idea to build SMS arises from the need of a managment system for
a specific educational center in Granada, that mainly speed up all
their internall management, avoid the spend of printed paper and save
huge amounts of time. Beside this they want a system that was helpful
for making better management decisions, in marking paths for future
improvements.\bigskip To achieve that the system would need as core
a subsystem of relationships managment, teachers that imparts class
to students, students that are enrollments in subjects and in groups
or courses, and a long etcetera. This only as the base of the system,
because with this would only be modeled the kind of relations that
the center have. A part of this and like the minimal requirements
the center need that the sistem provide a simple way to do their most
heavy and paper, time and money cost, the attendance contros (we can
start to see some requirements that the system would have). Appart
of this but related they need a system to save marks related with
students and disciplinary notes. Only this three things done digitally
may be a small internal revolution.

\section{The cost of non-digitalization}

Many times we do not perceive the cost of the processes in which we are involved
because we do not pay directly this cost or because we are so used to it that is
not evident.

\subsection{Paper}

How many papers are spended by a normal teacher in a high?

If we think that a normal teacher have a 8 groups of students (if it works in a
full time), this means 25 houres approximately at week, and each group have
25-30 student of average. In all, there are 200 students which a teacher have
relation approximately every year.

Each educational center has an own control sytem but normally and like is in this
case, there are a lot of standard documents that each teacher manages to follow
the evolution of their students (if it does their work fine).

We are going to make the calculus of these through the summary of the mainly
processes that they do.

\subsubsection{Marks and nottations}

To begin each teacher need to follow the evolution of each student in their
subject quarterly, to do this they uses an official document where they write
all interesting anotations about the student, from marks of partials or final
exams to annotation about homeworks or class issues.

If the common teacher (here "teacher") have 200 students and in the Spanish
system we have three quarter this make up a total of 600 sheets of paper,
more another 50 by differents uses that a teacher spend commonly.
Normally each center give to teacher a book with all this pages officialley
formated to this task, so the cost is upper that only the paper and ink.

If we multiply this number by 40 teachers aproximatly we have 2400.

\subsubsection{Tutorizing}

Each time that a parent want to check the evolution of his son the mentor
of the student need to do a simple but time and money expensive process.


So,if in a medium center we hace 15 mentors and each one mentorizing about
30 students, and technically each of this students need a meet with their
parents each quarter, this mean 15 * 30 * 3 * 10 subjects that the student have
 and that need an inform is equal to: 9000 pages.
Including some to the pedagogic center control.


\subsubsection{Delays}

Delays record is another process which spend paper. It is a very inefficient
whole of steps. To understand this better we are give you an example, when a
student is late (whatever the reason) a teacher need write in a officialy formated
page when it was late and why (according to it). After the student will move to
another palce of the center to give this paper to an admin stuff person that will
notify this to their parents (because the delay is not justified or them did not
konw).

This process means another 125 sheets per week between all students on average.

\subsubsection{Class attendances}

All weeks all teachers that impart class to a group write in a paper
all attendance controls of a class (independly of theri own records). This
is does between all teachers. So, in on avergae a center have around 1000 students
and around 25 students by course, more or less 40 courses and is neccesary
an attendance records paper by class, so is equal to 40 documents per week and
if the course have 32 weeks, the result is aproximately 1280 sheets of paper.



\subsubsection{Another center communications}

In addition to the above there are another kind of process in which big amounts
of paper is spended. When the direction of center want communicate something,
in some special days when is necesarry to do this or in some activities that
simply require paper.
In the most of cases the spend is only because there are not another better way
to do this, only for this reason. Somethimes some so easy as email or website or
simple a share document would be save a lot of money but the culture and the
dynamic of many places do difficult put into practice.


\subsubsection{Summarize}

With the follow constraint:

\begin{itemize}
\item A scholar course have 32 weeks at year on average (32-36 with 160-180 days).
\item The cost by printed page is about 0.03 cents of euros.
\item We are going to considere that a medium center have 1000 students an 40 teachers of average.
\item More or less 25 group of students
\item Each center have 15 mentors.
\end{itemize}


So, with this we can obtains this conclusion.

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{@{}lllllll@{}}

Process & Per week  & Per year  & Cost  \\
\midrule

Marks and annotations  &  --  &  26000  &   780      \euro  \\

\midrule
& & & & Total & 1238,4 \euro \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Equivalent stuff cost in managment tasks. }
\label{my-label}
\end{table}




\subsection{Time and Money}

Is not only the cost of the material resources, is also the time and their money
equivalence what we are trying to save.  If we count the hours of work that a
common teacher dedicate to do this we can estimate the cost that all student
managment related work required.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering

\begin{tabular}{@{}lllllll@{}}

Stuff & Amount & Hours/Month & At year & Price Hour & Total  \\
\midrule

Teacher     & 40 & 5    & 1800 h   & 15 \euro  & 27000  \euro  \\
Admin       & 3  & 10   & 270 h   & 15 \euro  & 4050   \euro  \\
Direction   & 4  & 10   & 360 h   & 20 \euro  & 7200   \euro  \\

\midrule
& & & & Total & 38250 \euro \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Equivalent stuff cost in managment tasks. }
\label{my-label}
\end{table}

This would be the cost if we think in the hours that all school stuff spend
in this kind of tasks and that are not been spended in projects of the own
center.
Can you imagine the amount of projects that would be doing with this huge
amount of houres of work by the stuff of the center?

The problem is allways the same, organization, control, and focused value. And
the common patter is not have a control over all and as thinks as this, the
companies lost alot of money and resources. The control of that happens in your
bussines is the most important and obviously is the only way to can take
decissions data based.

\subsection{Value of business}
Another thing that does go unnoticed is about the values of the data that a big
relational centers as school manage without any insight of their value.
In a standar center with 1000 students is generated around 10.000 records per
month, with a records schemas very basic. It is around 90.000 records per year
and if we have a more complex system with a lot data recorded the amount can be upper.
So, what happens with all of this data. There are any value? Obviously yes,
the explotation of this data is not very clear at first because the most of
people (centers directives included) not seen the center as a business, which
actually it is, only that our product is the quality of the teaching that we are
offering to our students.
So, as in any manufactured process there are a lot of steps that can be improved,
only if are controlled and measured. With students is the same (without any wrong
charm), there are a lot of steps, processes and stages that could be improved to
offer a better education.
If we detect that by whatever reason a student have a bad trend in their evolution
is very difficult to detect if we don't have a strong system to recollect data
and be able to do a fast actuation (proactive in oposite of late traditional
reactive behaviour) will be very difficult fix the problem.
And as there are a huge amount of data is difficult that anyone can process this
manually, and by this reason, is not easy too detect what part of our processes
fail or need to be improved.
All this problem can be easily solved with a powerfull system that can be recollect,
processes and give human-readable way all the conclusion obtained.
And this the other big mission of the kind of software like this, offer a
bunisses value of the data that help to manage.

\section{State of Art }

The develop of a new complete system have no sense if before have not been
analyzed other existent solutions. As part of the research process has been
analyses some aplications that (although is not a directly competition) represent
the actualstate of art about the kind of sofware we are talking about.

First we are take a look over the main features that are important in our domain
to see how many applications have covered them. This is a bit of requirements
analysis but not very formal, we will discuss about this after.

In the follow table we are going to compare the rest of app with our idylical
software (with the features we hope it will cover).

\end{tabular}
\caption{Features}
\label{my-label}
\end{table}

As we can see there are some apps that are so focused on their specific domain
that are very defficient in the rest. in spite of this are really referents in
their area and their numbers of users is huge (only have been compared apps that
really have a good acceptance by users).

But is not only important the features of the software, because with time and
effort any feature can be added. There are another things in the background that
are really important too and that can be that to grow our app steadily or that crash
when we have thousand of users. We are talking about something as data control,
performance, sacalability or centralización (we are not explain at detail each one because
is out of his work but we think is also very important).
And of course, all related with interface and user experience, that in most of
cases can represent the differnce between the successful and failure of our
project.

So, based of it this is our comparative:

\end{tabular}
\caption{Architecture and design}
\label{my-label}
\end{table}

\begin{flushleft}
Obviously, only in the hypothetical case of our app is fully developed will cover
all the aspects considered, but before of the research is easy to understand that
is not so difficult cover all with the correct design, architecture or design.

\bigskip
And we are going to try give a simple and really little aproximation of the way
to achieve that.

So, \textbf{let's go to start!}
\end{flushleft}
