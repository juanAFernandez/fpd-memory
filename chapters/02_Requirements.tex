\chapter{Requirements}

In this chapter wer are going to describe which are the requirement that
actually we system have to do that is expected from it.
It will be used User Stories methodology (footer y referencia a libro) which
it will be talked a bit more in the next chapter.
This tool will be usedfull to identify the requirements of the system by a
human readable way. Removing all possible layer between desing and user requisites.

\section{Minimal user requirements}

The managers of the center can't have a precise idea about which must be the functions of the sofware. They have a clear idea about what kind of process in their daily work there are the most heavy and consume more paper, that are which they want to digitalice, but they haven't think about navbars, icons, colors palettes, designe of user interfaces or something like this.  They have abstract ideas that will need dimensioning and shaping but which in synthesis offer the minimun system requirements.

\subsection{General needs}
How is talking about software, it will need run in somewhere, and they what to be cheap and easy to run. And at first there aren't any prerequirements. Maybe they preffer that this can run in devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, but they don't have a good technical knowlements and is indiferents that be a native app, a web app or some strange artefact.
For other hand exists an essential requirements, must be run in any devide for the same person, independently of the machine where it be (sometimes in laptop and sometimes in smartphone, for example).

\subsection{Academic Management System}


As base of requirements process have been used user stories.

% ##############

As we can imagine, a center have a lot of differents kind of relationships, and as obligatory part of the system it must be offer a simple way to do this. Teachers imparts subjects to group of students (called classes), students are enrolled in subjects, and so on. These cases of use and all it can see below will be revised as \textit{User Stories} in detail later.

\break
\subsubsection{Attendance Controls}
\bigskip

One of most importat proccess to digitaly, the amount of data tha is saved on
papper and also imposible to manage before and much less do it an analysis.
They need a simple way, a simple interface to do this that allow this save time
(doing it, analysis and mangement it), paper and effort.

\bigskip
\subsection{Class Controls}
\bigskip

A part of manage of classrooms they must offers a say to follow the students evolution in class, behaviour, positives and negativss and another lot of things like paper save, time and effort as section above.

\bigskip
\subsection{Marks} % I would say this is grades. You really have to check

As another of proccess that more paper consumes is the marks management. They want a system that simplity the proccess of insertion, analysis and management. Without any specially idea in mind are open to any good user interface that simplify this.


\bigskip
\subsection{Disciplinary Notes}
\bigskip

It also must provide a management of this kind of notes, in which a bad behaviour of a studnet is saved, managed and fully reported to the specific users inside of app, as tutors, pedagogue, etc, for example.

\bigskip
\subsection{Simple and advance reports}
\bigskip

Another part interesting for they is improve the reports that they obtains from their data. The on paper support do this almost imposible to big scale, an a important feature must be do this posible. Advanced reports about a lot of kind of items, like students, state of subjects, marks, etc, in seconds with some cliks.
This will improve the take of decisions and will do better meetings with better decisions based on good and crontastable data.


An user stoire by subsystem: repot by marks, report by attendance control..
reports by.., etc ,etc etc....

\bigskip
\subsection{Autonomic Official System Connection}
\bigskip

The national system of education in which this center is framed have a diferents informatic reginal system. In this case, in Andalucia, where the certer is it called SENECA (other in other places of the country). All public and semipublic educaitonal centers need save data in this systems necessarily, and this haven't a simple public API where connet us. They must be done dirty way, making a maxed mode way to simplify the download and download of data that minify the interaction with the official system.
